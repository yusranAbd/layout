    <p>In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a footer. On smaller screens, the columns will
        stack on top of each other.</p>
    <p>Resize the browser window to see the responsive effect (you will learn more about this in our next chapter - HTML
        Responsive.)</p>
